üëã Hello I'm Robin<br>
üêß Daily driving GNU/linux<br>
üîê Believing in the future of encryption<br>
üëê Supporting open source projects<br>
üîí Privacy is a human right<br>
üó† Data tells the truth<br>
üïµÔ∏è "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."
